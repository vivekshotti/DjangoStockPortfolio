Django has inbuilt authentication and database systems.<p>
  


<h2>To run this on your system, follow the following steps:</h2><p>

* Step (1) -> Download / Clone this repository on your system.<p>
* Step (2.1) -> If you have downloaded the above folder in zip format : 
  * Create a folder called ***djangostock*** in your C drive.
  * Copy all the contents of the zip folder in this new one <p>
* Step (2.2) -> If you have cloned the above folder on some other folder on your desktop/other location : 
  * Create a folder called ***djangostock*** in your C drive.
  * Copy all the contents of your cloned folder in this new one <p>
* Step (3) -> Open your _cmd_ or _git-bash_ terminal and run pwd. Ususally the default location would be :
  *   ```
      /c/users/your_current-loggedin_username
      ```
* Step (4) -> Run the _cd .._ command twice to exit the current directory and come to C Drive. Then write _cd djangostock_ in your terminal. If you have followed the above steps thoroughly, your terminal will display :
  *   ```
      /c/djangostock
      ```
* Step (5) -> Now we have to install virtual enviroment in this directory to run our django project. If you have Pip installed previously, write the following command:
  *   ```
      pip install virtualenv
      ```
* Step (6) -> Now we have to install django in your virtual enviroment. Firstly, write the following command to go into your virtual enviroment directory:
  *   ```
      cd venv
      ```
  *   Then write in your terminal:
      ```
      pip install django
      ```
* Step (7) -> Now we have everything installed. To run the virtual enviroment on your local host, come out of the _venv_ folder and into the _stocks_ folder and  write the following command:
  *   ```
      python manage.py runserver
      ```
* Step (8) -> If the above doesn't work, find the manger.py python file in your folder and run from that directory.
* Step (9) -> Go to the browser you use normally and type ***localhost:8000***. Yes it runs on that port.
* Step (10) -> To exit / close the localhost / server, go to your termainal and press ***CTRL + C***.
